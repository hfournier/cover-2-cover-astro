We are so excited that our new lineup will be playing a SOLD OUT concert April 13th at Montreal Real Foods on Kirschner in Kelowna. Gilles Lesage on bass and Robert Vallee will be joining Jim and Kim to play a night of original songs written by Smitten as well as some of our very favourite songs in the history of classic rock!

Fasten your seat belts for some great 4-part harmony vocals such as: Lady by LIttle River Band, Carry on Wayward Son by Kansas, Don't Fear The Reaper by Blue Oyster Cult, Listen To The Music by Doobie Brothers, Hold The Line by Toto and Josie by Steely Dan.

We will also be joined by local legend Bob Silversides for his songs Danny and Your Momma Don't Dance from his days playing keys with Loggins & Messina. A secret Canadian celebrity guest might also sit in for a song.

Montreal Real Foods is located on Kirschner Road in Kelowna. Doors open at 6:00 and the show starts at 7:00.
