It's our favourite time of year to play a fun classic rock dance for our friends and fans. What better fun than Halloween - a great chance for fans of great dance music from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s to come out with their friends, let loose and really have a blast.

Saturday, October 26, 2019 is the date for the hottest Halloween Dance in Kelowna this year at the Ukrainian Catholic Church at 1091 Coronation Street in downtown Kelowna.

The theme this year is "Night At The Movies" and we have some fantastic Halloween dance songs picked along with all the great classic songs you've come to expect from **Cover2Cover**. So come dressed up.
