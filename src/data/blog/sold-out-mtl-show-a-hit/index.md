We were blown away by the support of our **Cover2Cover** friends and fans at Saturday night's concert. It was a packed house and the crowd at MTL was excited for the show. It was not only the premier of Rhindress's original songs with a band, but it was also the premier performance of the new **Cover2Cover** with Gilles Lesage on Bass, Robert Vallee on Drums, Jim Rhindress on guitar and Kim Foreman-Rhindress on keys.

Jim and Kim were looking forward to playing their ten original songs as part of their duo Rhindress (www.rhindressmusic.com) with Gilles and Bobby. Hearing the songs with a full band really charged them with a whole new energy.

Guest performer local keyboard legend Bob Silversides played two fantastic songs - Feelin' All Right and Danny's Song with the band in the first act. The audience was wowed by Bob's keyboard skills and the honest sincerity of his vocals.

In the second act, Canadian actor Shaun Johnston of CBC television series Heartland sat in for two songs - Folsom Prison Blues (with Shaun on harmonica and vocals) and Don't Fear The Reaper with Shaun on the mandatory cow bell. Shouts of "More cow bell!!!" could be heart from the enthusiastic audience.
